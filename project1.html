  <p>The name is Kristen and I recently eloped into the Navy to my exponentially more patient, calm, and altogether better half . .  .  but he'll never hear me say that!</p>
  <p>No children yet but we do have two furbabies, Laycee May the 103 lb <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/s/swissneese.htm">Swissneese</a> and Atlas the <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/s/saintbernewfie.htm">St. Bernewfie</a> puppy, weighing in at 15 lbs at just 7 weeks old. He most likely will weigh more than me once he's all grown up.</p>
  <p>My little family is currently living in San Diego, California until my husband retires from the Navy where it is back to Texas we go! No hard feelings California, I just miss Texas.<img src="Hhollyk.github.io/Atlas Edit.jpg"/></p>
