An Analytical Breakdown of Two Websites
Two websites with entirely different functions, AllRecipes and BringFido, have been selected to be analyzed using some techniques demonstrated throughout Letting Go of the Words by Janice (Ginny) Redish. Some such examples include each websites’ strengths and weaknesses when determining as well as catering to their audience, accessibility for users with disabilities, and their ability to target their audience while utilizing the bite, snack, and meal concept that Redish explains.

Determining the Websites’ Audience and Keeping Them
The layout and wording of the website is crucial in determining the audience that will be attracted. Most websites’ preferred font type is anything that is sans serif which is less difficult to read at a hurried pace which people typically do while skimming for information. (61) BringFido and AllRecipes main font are both a sans serif of varying sizes which allows the audience to quickly scan the site while easily identifying the headings and key messages. (136-38) BringFido’s font towards the top of the page is more curly and decorative while being very big while also featuring a background of a dog which changes every time the website is accessed again, which appeals to their whimsical feel displayed on the homepage. This sets the persona of being more playful and fun with an edge of adventurousness to help connect them with their audience which are people that are interested in going to varying places with their animals. Once the search has been completed the next page looks more professional which lets the audience know that it is time to quit skimming as fast and start applying some more time to the information they are looking up. AllRecipes also uses sans serif fonts but the page is of a more professional persona catering to those that are beginners as well as those that are expert cooks. The background and font are of a high contrast with a more professional font throughout with enlarged font to dictate recipe titles or pathway links. There are also massive amounts of pictures featured next to the recipe titles in order to capture the audiences’ attention and get them to commit to a recipe on their site because of how beautifully the food has been photographed. Obviously because of this feature, AllRecipes is not as user friendly for those that have some sort of disability that hinders their ability to navigate the website.

Accessibility for Those with Disabilities
After listening to Damen Rose, who was featured on Ouch: Disability Talks, describe his experiences as a blind man trying to navigate the internet as well as texting, simplicity was put into perspective as being vital, not boring. Comparing the minimalism of BringFido to the complexity of AllRecipes, one can easily see how the layout of AllRecipes could be difficult for someone with a disability to navigate. WebAIM states that approximately 20% of the population has some form of disability that effects their ability to successfully and easily navigate the internet. A major strength that BringFido has is the simplicity of its Homepage being “content-rich with few words” while also sticking to a more modest design. (74) BringFido as well as AllRecipes are capable of catering to those that have disabilities that hinder their access or usability to the internet by placing a search bar with a simple drop down menu towards the top of the page so that those using screen-reading software will not have to listen to an entire page of information before they find the search bar. (85) The downside is that while the background of BringFido is usually featuring a dog, AllRecipes is full of pictures on the homepage that continue to scroll down a considerable amount of time. If one were blind then AllRecipes would probably be incredibly difficult and frustrating to listen to being read off. One of the main downsides on BringFido for being disability friendly, is that while using the search bar, instead of clicking go or enter to start the search, it uses the word “fetch” which is really cute but when someone has a disability, it may be confusing or frustrating to them. 

Capturing the Audiences’ Attention: Bite, Snack, Meal
Although AllRecipes and BringFido do not instantly allow the user to know what the content of the website is, both websites make use of a heading that follows the website name. For example, BringFido.com – Pet Friendly Hotel & Dog Travel Directory, which allows those that are using a search engine to pull up BringFido because it uses phrases such as pet friendly and travel; the same goes for AllRecipes – Food, friends, and recipe inspiration. As Redish says, by putting the visitors’ words within the heading, both websites are able to attract larger amounts of traffic. (181) A strength that both BringFido and AllRecipes also have is that their headlines act as a bite in capturing the audiences’ attention within the first few seconds of them reaching the homepage. Regardless of how well laid out or informational a website may be, if they cannot attract and keep the attention of their audience, then the website will never be utilized. (163) BringFido is a more simple, less cluttered example in the snack department because like previously stated, they have a very minimalistic layout that asks “Where do you want to bring Fido?” featuring a search bar just below it, while AllRecipe takes the initiative to display multiple different snacks in the form of picture of favorite recipes all on the homepage featuring a search bar at the very top along with pathway pages. AllRecipes, although somewhat hectic at first glance, offers the audience any recipe they could possibly be searching for within that homepage via navigation through pathway pages, the search bar, or even the featured recipes of that day towards the bottom with their delicious pictures. 

Summarizing Strengths and Weaknesses
When looking at the website with the perspective of someone that has a disability, the less trying choice to use would be BringFido aside from the “fetch” issue that was already mentioned while AllRecipes relies heavily on their visual effects with their use of so many pictures. When it comes to applying the bite, snack, meal concept and catering to the audience as well as capturing their attention, the best website would be AllRecipes because they have pictures, catchy titles, as well as an eye appealing background in order to quickly satisfy their audience, sometimes to the point of getting lost for hours on their website. Whereas BringFido is lacking in the wow department with their large all picture background and a single lone search bar sitting by itself centered in the middle of the page. In addition to the single search bar on BringFido, at the very top of the page is an incredibly simple, so simple you don’t even notice it is there, small pathway page up at the top that is exactly the same as the dropdown box in the search bar. In terms of determining the websites’ audience and keeping them, both websites end up in a draw because they both create personas catering to their audience.
