				<li>"She went through a few things. Of course she was going to make some enemies along the way. A smart woman is a beautiful woman. A beautiful woman is a dangerous woman. A dangerous woman is an intimidating woman. And those reasons alone are too much for some. It mattered to her though. She still carried some of the dead weight she swore to shed. It wasn't easy letting everyone, or anyone, in. You can't force a flower to bloom. It does so at its own pace, under just the right conditions. And there's no going back. Only growth. Only forward. I suppose that's what the thorns were for. Whether you could handle her or not, you sure as hell would feel her." - J. Raymond</li>
	            <li>"Sometimes the smallest step in the right direction ends up being the biggest step of your life. Tip toe if you must, but take the step." - Unknown</li>
	            <li>"Just because you don't look like somebody who you think is attractive doesn't mean you aren't attractive. Flowers are pretty but so are Christmas lights and they look nothing alike." - sscreamss</li>
