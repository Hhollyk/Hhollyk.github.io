I would like to apologize in advance because you are going to be subjugated to my opinions and feelings about working with Codecademy as I stumbled my way through it. This reflection will not be pretty and will closely sound like I was relatively hopeless the whole time. As a side note, the reality is .  .  . that I was exactly that, hopeless. 
I feel as if Codecademy’s model is “let’s jump right in” which is great and also horrifying to some extent. So far, the hardest part was correct coding placement to use an image as a way to access or take a person to a different site. My mistake was that I would put the image first then the access code following it, which would create a hyperlink to anything I had following the <a code instead of my beautiful picture. Not going to lie, Google saved me. Google=1 and Kristen=0 
Let’s move on to my next source of torture. It all began with “1. Under your <h1> tag, create a paragraph using the <p> tag which describes the list you will make.” Sounds easy enough right? Wrong!! So I’m just making a paragraph right so how come I can’t close it properly? 
*Looking back, life was easy when I was at this stage in Codecademy, oh how little did I understand that what lies ahead would borderline break my sanity.*
For Module 2, Exercise 5, it did not specify under the “hint” that the paragraph is acting as a sort of title instead of the Unordered List being a part of the whole paragraph. Seriously frustrated to the ends of this earth for a solid 15 minutes until I looked up the FAQ on the lesson. Apparently I was not the only one with this problem or who thought the instructions as well as the help were misleading. Google=2 and Kristen=0
At first, understanding the exact coding for changing the font color, size, and style was a little difficult until I FINALLY got the first one correct, then from there it was all repetitive coding and most hiccups disappeared. This portion of the lesson was probably my favorite, well that and changing all of the different colors. That would probably be my favorite part, changing anything to do with the font or background. During the lesson on how to change the background, Codecademy would not let me continue on until I capitalized the hex color code even though it is not supposed to be case sensitive. Google=3 and Kristen=0
When finally putting together my own social media page, it was easy to forget which combination of letters to apply after inserting and image, for example the src or the href. After walking away from the modules and not working on any code, I would easily forget what the letters even were, I just knew that I had to put something after <img. I would also forget if I was supposed to close it with a /img> or just a > or even just a />. Not only was remembering the letters hard but I couldn’t seem to remember to put an = after the src or href then the quotation marks (“) which would mess up the whole code. Almost every single time I would have to check the hints just to remind me what I was doing wrong or missing followed up by my friend Google. Google=like 7 or so and Kristen=0
One of the more difficult parts to learn was creating the code for a link that is attached to a picture or wrapped around a picture. Just remembering to put an <a then href, insert link, then I would mess up how to close it without cutting it off from the actual image that follows. 
Once CSS was added to HTML it was a little tricky at first and confusing because the layouts are different. For whatever reason, my mind could not connect the dots where I was supposed to enter information on the CSS page. Then during the Syntax for the Wintax portion it wants you to write the code on the stylesheets side but if you have never done it before, you have no clue what it is even wanting from you. I had no clue that I was supposed to put the p before the { because all of the examples/hints that were provided said selector{ so I was literally typing that out and wondering what I was doing wrong. It seems as if they forget that people who are extremely inexperienced with computers take things literally because we do not know any better, or it’s just the way my thought process works.
So basically, the whole thing from the beginning to the end gave me difficulty. Whether it was remembering the proper sequences or forgetting entire blocks of information, I managed to mess up on it all. It doesn’t help that I’m slightly a perfectionist about random things, such as the aligning for my title during the project that created the table. Centering anything, whether vertical or horizontal aligned, still remains difficult for me. I could manage to get it horizontally aligned where I would want the text to be, but applying a vertical alignment still alludes me regardless of how often I sought the help of Google. Also as a side note, this right here forever eludes me, link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css" every time I need to link the CSS to the HTML which just gives more points to Google. 
While I continue to say that everything gave me a hard time, I was somewhat able to understand what the overall goal and concept was. However, as soon as it came time to learn about styling such as classes and ID’s, there was no hope in all the Googling I attempted to be found. Sure, I would find some examples but it was like learning a math problem where you have no clue why you are doing something, just that you are supposed to do it. In situation like that, it is always harder to remember what it is you are even supposed to do because it does not contain any meaning. When working on the CSS page, it was difficult to determine what type of code would need to be placed before the {. That is probably my absolute biggest struggle then when referring to the hint to get unstuck, it just refers to everything as “selector” when I have no clue what selector I need to place there. This was my biggest struggle while trying to complete my final module for the resume. I could not get the wording inside one of my div(s) so everything was below it looking beyond messed up.
Well I did it, I fought and cried my whole way through all 6 Modules while slaughtering code every step of the way, and just about all I can say about that is, may the Internet god have mercy on my poor soul for future endeavors. Final tally, Google=15 and Kristen=1. To be honest, I completely lost track of how many times I had to rely on Google so there’s that and I had to give myself at least one point; self-love people!
